Gauche-threadlib is a high-level thread library for Gauche Scheme.

Writing multi-thread applications only with primitive functions is not
easy because you have to deal with low-level things, like explicit
synchronization or threads management.  This library abstructs such
things so that writing multi-thread application become easier and
error-prone.

This is inspired by java.util.concurent, which is a standard library
for Java.

[Shiro Kawai]: This library is originally written by Rui Ueyama.
It has lots of good parts and I intend to incorporate most of them
into Gauche core.  For the timing, I put the library here so that
anybody interested can hack it.
